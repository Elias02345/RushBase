## M0 demo

Prerequisites: Docker, and nothing else on the host: `make setup` fetches Python 3.12 (uv),
pnpm packages and, if the Docker Compose plugin is missing, a checksum-verified standalone
`docker-compose` into the project toolchain.

```sh
make setup           # Python 3.12 via uv, Python and web dependencies
make lint typecheck test
make testmedia       # synthetic clips, audio, photos, camera-card structure, junk files
make dev             # postgres (15432), samba (14450), migrations, server (18080), web (15173)
```

Then, in another terminal:

```sh
curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:18080/health          # {"status":"ok","version":"0.1.0","database":true}
curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:15173/api/health      # same, through the Vite proxy
# browse to http://127.0.0.1:15173               # landing page: health ring, dark mode, DE/EN toggle
uv run rushbase doctor --library dev/library --server-url http://127.0.0.1:18080
make dev-down        # stops only the rushbase-dev compose project
```

`rushbase doctor` reports `error` for missing `ffmpeg`, `ffprobe` or `exiftool`; install them
on the machine that runs a worker. Exit code 1 means at least one check failed.

## M1 demo

Prerequisites as for M0 (`make setup`, Docker). Everything below runs against the isolated dev
stack.

```sh
make lint typecheck test       # includes the PostgreSQL tests (each session uses its own database)
make dev-up                    # postgres + samba, applies migrations 0001 and 0002
scripts/kill-test.sh           # SIGKILLs a fake worker mid-job, asserts the job is re-leased
```

Run the server and walk through the flow (dev credentials come from `dev/data/dev.env`):

```sh
scripts/with-dev-env.sh uv run rushbase-server &      # lease taken in dev/library/.rushbase/library.json
curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:18080/health               # database, library_mounted, lease_held, setup_required
curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:18080/api/v1/setup         # needs_setup, restore_available
curl -fsS -c jar -X POST http://127.0.0.1:18080/api/v1/setup \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{"username":"admin","password":"choose a long password"}'
make testmedia                                        # junk, sidecars, a camera card into dev/library/Input
# after the stability window (2 scans and 120 s by default) the files become assets with jobs:
curl -fsS -b jar http://127.0.0.1:18080/api/v1/status # backlog per stage: jobs, files, bytes, duration
CSRF=$(grep rb_csrf jar | awk '{print $7}')
curl -fsS -b jar -X POST http://127.0.0.1:18080/api/v1/admin/enrollment-tokens \
  -H "X-CSRF-Token: $CSRF" -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{"note":"demo"}'
scripts/with-dev-env.sh uv run rushbase-server backup now
scripts/with-dev-env.sh uv run rushbase-server backup list
```

The backup commands need `pg_dump`; without a local PostgreSQL client set
`RUSHBASE_PG_DOCKER_CONTAINER=rushbase-dev-postgres-1` (development only).

The OpenAPI schema (`/openapi.json`, client in `packages/api-client`) documents the worker protocol
(`/api/v1/worker/*`), authentication, administration and `/api/v1/status`.

### Notes on M1 behaviour

- `finalize` runs on the server. Filing (rules, rename, sidecars, journal) arrives with M2, so in
  M1 it only records that the analysis is complete and moves the asset to `review`.
- Failed assets are marked `quarantined` and the intent is written to the audit log; the physical
  move to `.rushbase/quarantine/` is part of M2.
- Default pipeline: `probe, hash, preview, shots, finalize`. The AI stages (`audio`, `embed`,
  `vision`, `classify`) exist in the schema and the planner but are off until M4.
- Without any worker the server still serves status, backlog and administration (ADR-0012). Setting
  `RUSHBASE_INPROCESS_STAGES=hash` lets the server hash files itself; `probe` joins in M2.
- Restoring: start `rushbase-server` against an empty database on an existing library; `GET
  /api/v1/setup` lists the backups, then `rushbase-server backup restore <file>`.
- `scripts/kill-test.sh` starts a private server with short timings when nothing listens on 18080;
  against a running dev server set `KILL_TEST_USER`/`KILL_TEST_PASSWORD` (it then needs minutes
  because of the default 120 s lease).
